# CSE4117 Microprocessors Projects
## Description

This repository was made public on XX/XX/2022.

This repository contains all the work we did for the three projects assigned to us as part of the CSE4117 Microprocessors course at Marmara University.

The main focus of each project was to implement a CPU design, which was covered in course lectures, in the Logisim circuit simulation software and on a Cyclone IV FPGA using Verilog. The project assignments also included writing assembly code to accomplish some task and implementing an assembler to go along with it, which was given in an incomplete state and written in C. We chose to write our own assembler from scratch in Python, which in the end ended up being a great decision to make early on.

The PDF files describing each project will be added later.
